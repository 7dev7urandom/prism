# Prism
Prism is a simple python package for fetching and displaying user stats from Hypixel.
Currently only bedwars stats are supported.

## Scripts
Prism comes with two example scripts:

1. [`stats.py`](./examples/stats.py) - Check the stats of specific players
1. [`overlay`](./examples/overlay) - Check the stats of all players in your lobby when you type `/who`
