# Hystatutils
Hystatutils is a simple python package for fetching and displaying user stats from Hypixel.
Currently only bedwars stats are supported.

## Scripts
Hystatutils comes with two example scripts:

1. [`stats.py`](./stats.py) - Check the stats of specific players
1. [`sidelay.py`](./sidelay.py) - Check the stats of all players in your lobby when you type `/who`
