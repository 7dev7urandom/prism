# Nick database

[nick\_database.json](./nick_database.json) is generated from data scraped from hypixel posted [here](https://hypixel.net/threads/hypixel-game-data-hypixel-denicking.4415597/). The data is from summer 2021, and is static, so it may be outdated. In practice this means that any nick acquired after summer 2021 is not in the database, or may denick to the wrong player.
